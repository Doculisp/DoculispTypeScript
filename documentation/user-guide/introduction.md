## What is Doculisp?

Doculisp is a **documentation composition tool** that helps you write better, more maintainable documentation. Instead of wrestling with one massive README file that becomes harder to manage over time, Doculisp lets you break your documentation into smaller, focused pieces that are easier to write, edit, and collaborate on.

Think of it like building with LEGO blocks ‚Äì instead of carving one giant piece of stone, you create small, reusable pieces that snap together perfectly to form something beautiful and functional.

### The Documentation Problem You Know Too Well

If you've ever worked on a project (whether it's software, research, or any collaborative work), you've probably experienced these frustrations:

**The Massive File Problem:**
- Your README.md file has grown to 300+ lines
- Finding specific information feels like searching for a needle in a haystack
- Making small changes requires scrolling through endless text

**The Collaboration Nightmare:**
- Multiple people can't edit documentation simultaneously without conflicts
- Changes get lost in huge file diffs
- It's hard to review what actually changed in a documentation update

**The Maintenance Burden:**
- Keeping table of contents in sync with content is manual work
- Cross-references break when you reorganize sections
- Updating similar information across multiple places is error-prone

### How Doculisp Solves These Problems

<!-- (dl (##modular-approach Modular Approach)) -->

**Instead of one huge file, create many focused files:**
- `installation.md` - Just installation instructions
- `getting-started.md` - Quick start tutorial
- `advanced-features.md` - Deep dive topics
- `troubleshooting.md` - Common problems and solutions

**Doculisp automatically combines these into a polished final document.**
