<!-- (dl (# Fixed)) -->
- **Multiline Code Block Parsing**: Fixed a bug where multiline code blocks defined with 4 or more backticks would cause the compiler to fail and report a malformed markdown document
  - Code blocks with 4+ backticks are now properly recognized and parsed
  - Closing markers no longer require trailing whitespace and can end at line boundaries
  - Prevents compilation failures for valid markdown documents containing extended code blocks
