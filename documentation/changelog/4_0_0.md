<!-- (dl (# Breaking Changes)) -->
- **Pure CLI Architecture**: Converted from library + CLI to pure CLI application
  - **Removed Library API**: All internal TypeScript APIs, containers, parsers, and type interfaces have been removed from the public API surface
  - **CLI Only**: The package now functions exclusively as a command-line tool, no longer exposable as a library
  - **Massive Codebase Reduction**: Removed over 15,000 lines of internal implementation code that was previously part of the public API
  - **Package Simplification**: Dramatically reduced package complexity and installation footprint
  - This is a breaking change for any projects that were importing DoculispTypeScript as a library rather than using it as a CLI tool
