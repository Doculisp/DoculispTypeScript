<!-- (dl (# Fixed)) -->
- **Path Handling**: Fixed bug in `PathHandler` constructor where file extension property was incorrectly set
  - Fixed conditional logic that was always assigning the extension value even when it should be `false`
  - Files without extensions now properly return `false` for the extension property instead of an empty string
  - This ensures consistent behavior when checking file extensions in path operations
